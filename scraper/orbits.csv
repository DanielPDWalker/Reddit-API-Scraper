index,Orbit Acronym,Orbit Name,Orbit Altitude (km),Orbit Inclination (Â°),Launch Capability,Comments
0,SO,Suborbital,N/A,Any,Yes,"A flight trajectory with enough kinetic energy to reach space, but not enough energy to reach orbit"
1,LEO,Low Earth Orbit,"160 - 2,000",Any,Yes,"Geocentric orbit, low altitude"
2,MEO,Medium Earth Orbit,"2,000 -  35,786",Any,N/A,"Geocentric orbit, medium altutude"
3,GSO,Geosynchronous Orbit,"35,786",Any,No,"Geocentric Orbit, same orbital period as Earth's rotational period; A Geostationary orbit is also a Geosynchronous orbit."
4,HEO,High Earth Orbit,">35,786",Any,Yes,"Geocentric Orbit, high altitude"
5,SSO,Sun-synchronous Orbit,N/A,N/A,Yes,Geocentric orbit that combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planet's surface at the same local solar time.
6,PO,Polar Orbit,N/A,90,Yes,Orbit in which a satellite passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited
7,GTO,Geostationary Transfer Orbit,N/A,N/A,Yes,Hohmann transfer orbit used to reach geosynchronous or geostationary orbit
8,GEO,Geostationary Orbit,"35,786",~0,Yes,"Orbit mostly used by communication satellites, the satellite has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period (one sidereal day) and orbits over the equator , thus appearing at a fixed position in the sky."
9,BEO,Beyond Earth Orbit,N/A,N/A,N/A,Any location or orbit outside of the Earth's gravitational influence
10,DRO,Distant Retrograde Orbit,N/A,N/A,N/A,"A highly stable lunar orbit, proposed as the destination for the ARM asteroid"
11,TLI,Trans Lunar Injection,N/A,N/A,Yes,Propulsive maneuver performed in geocentric orbit which puts an object on a trajectory towards the moon
12,LOI,Lunar Orbit Insertion,N/A,N/A,No,Propulsive maneuver performed during Lunar fly-by which forces a spacecraft into Lunar orbit
13,TMI,Trans Mars Injection,N/A,N/A,Yes,Propulsive maneuver performed in geocentric orbit which puts an object on a Mars-intercepting heliocentric orbit
14,MOI,Mars Orbit Insertion,N/A,N/A,No,Propulsive maneuver performed during Mars fly-by which forces a spacecraft into an areocentric orbit
